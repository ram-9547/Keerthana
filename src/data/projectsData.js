      `Netspam can find featuresâ€™ importance even without ground truth and only relying on metapath definition and
        based on values calculated for each review. Netspam improves accuracy compared to state-of-the-art in terms of
        time complexity, which highly depends on the number of features used to identify a spam review, hence using
        features with more weight will result in detecting fake reviews more easily with less time complexity. In this
        project, Java is used as a scripting language and for developing the algorithms.
        Content Based algorithm: This algorithm is used to detect whether the message or the the comment given is
        spam or not. This is similar to item-based collaborative filtering.

      educational institutions are unable to conduct examinations to the students due to the outbreak of Corona
      Virus.
      Visual Studio Code, XAMPP, SVM, and Linear Regression Algorithms are used`
